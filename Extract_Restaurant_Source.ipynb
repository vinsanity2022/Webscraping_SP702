For the a la carte, we...had to sit in the lobby lounge area with a low table and deep sofas so it was difficult to eat comfortably even though there were plenty of free seats in the restaurant. Many things on the menu weren't available and the waitress was going back and forth to check things with the kitchen. My husband's curry was tiny and my tofu dish had far too much tofu and little veg it wasn't nice. Service was ABSOLUTELY terrible. It took forever to ask for the bill, the waitress took our card for payment and didn't return for a while. I walked to the bar area to ask what was happening. Our card was just sitting behind the bar and the barman just replied saying he needed a signature. I told him we've been waiting and worried about where our card was.\\n\\nThe Radisson is tucked away in its own complex so getting a grab taxi back to our hotel was impossible. The security guard found us a taxi and we paid more than what we paid to the hotel but we were happy to be out of the Radisson Blu. \\n\\nI wholly wouldn't recommend Faria restaurant.

For reference we have spent a lot of money at this place pre and post pandemic. We are good for taking home baked goods and me personally I am a general 20% tipper. The last time we showed up only one table occupied in the air conditioned part of the place and nobody was outside. We asked for a table was shown a glass topped table which never would have worked for our two year old. I asked for another table told it was reserved I asked for two tables to be put together was told no. I could not believe the gall of the staff. We left in a hurry myself very loudly cursing the place. How do you fail to accommodate a somewhat regular customer ? Well they do not get a chance for a redeux. Last time I was there our waitress got 1000 peso tip were she there the Sunday we were not given a table I am sure she would have intervened. Sadly I will never patronize this restaurant again.

At 9 am many of the food selections were not being refilled even though breakfast was until 10. \\nAt dinner the service was...better. Their pizza is baked in a wood-fired brick oven and was delicious. I thought their pasta was subpar though, my husband thought his spaghetti and meatball was \"just okay\", our daughter said her carbonara was average and my lamb ragout was too salty.

Many things on the menu weren't available and the waitress was going back and forth to check things with the kitchen. My husband's curry was tiny and my tofu dish had far too much tofu and little veg it wasn't nice. Service was ABSOLUTELY terrible. It took forever to ask for the bill, the waitress took our card for payment and didn't return for a while. I walked to the bar area to ask what was happening. Our card was just sitting behind the bar and the barman just replied saying he needed a signature.

Last time I was there our waitress got 1000 peso tip were she there the Sunday we were not given a table I am sure she would have intervened. Sadly I will never patronize this restaurant again.
