I had the seafood soup and jumbo prawns risotto and he had salmon carpaccio that was not on the menu but the chef offered to prepare and the oxtail ravioli. Extra points for the delicious sauce on the raviolis. To finish we had some chocolate cake offered by the chef and i have to highlight the texture as it was perfect, of course the taste was also super good.More', 'faith840', 'Ate here while staying at the resort.
