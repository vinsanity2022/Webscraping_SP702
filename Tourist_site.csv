You will have to line up to see the Santo Nino statue, but while on line you can admire the fine architecture of this beautiful basilica. In the plaza, do not forget to have one of the prayer ladies dance some prayers for you. It certainly can't hurt!"", 'Kyle Paes', ""The place is very historical. It's full of relics from the past and statues of saints.  The staff really require people to pay respect to the place by letting tourist wear portable skirts that they lend before you enter the church. There are tourist who do not know about the culture of the Philippines and luckily the staff understands. They are very polite and kind when they lend the skirts to tourists. \n\nThe only thing that makes me wonder is why wouldn't they allow people especially filmmakers to shoot inside the place even if the film festival/competition is organized by the Sinulog Foubdation. \n\nProfessional photographers are still around in this area at a price you can afford. \n\nOverall, the place is a must to visit when you're in Cebu. \n\nThe crowded photo was taken during the Sinulog Festival. The place is not that crowded when the festival is not yet nearing."", 'Marty', 'Basilica del Santo Nino ... is a splendid historical Catholic Church located downtown Cebu City , next to the Magellan Cross \n\nAs each time I visit , the Church grounds ( like the candle pray area ) there are plenty of Catholic devotees \n\nEven if not Catholic or even not religious ...

Was there on weekday and had a mass starting outside of all places.  So many people attend that they have outdoor structure where parishioners can sit under the bleachers.

The basilica holds a significant place in Filipino history as it houses the Santo Niño, a revered Catholic icon and the oldest religious relic in the country.

Kawasan Falls,Waterfalls,"Matutinao, Badian 6031 Philippines","1,936","['Eaten A', 'There was a bit of a walk in along a track, not terribly far but not close either.  You have to pay to park, pay to get in and when you reach the end you arrive at the falls which has a seating and restaurant area which is right next to the pond at the bottom of the falls.  Ruined the illusion of a forest falls a little and we were charged P600 to hire a table to sit at so you either pay or you’re sort of stuffed.  I’d say crowded is not an unfair word to use.  It was nice enough, the falls themselves are nice but not hugely spectacular and you can swim or paddle at least in the pond extending from it.  The bottom of the pond has sharpish volcanic rock so wear some footwear.  I would not go out of my way to go there again unless family had a desire to, a swim in the pool would have been as nice for me as a waterfall directly adjacent a restaurant isn’t quite scenic for me,  I didn’t hate the experience nor did I love it.  Refreshing enough but for me just OK.  You might love it, don’t let my honest review put you off if you are leaning toward going.', 'Malta569', 'We ventured to the beautiful Kawasan falls on a one day excursion. It was truly an amazing experience. We paid 1300PHP (£19.70) per person from a local shop next to the French Cafe in Panagsama Beach. This included pick up from our hotel in Moalboal Centre. The excursion included Canyoneering which was epic and the falls were beautiful! On arrival at the Falls we paid an additional 500PHP (£7..60) per person to do Zip lining). It saved a 45 mins walk through the forest to the actual falls and it was great fun! Lunch was also included and a drink with it. \n\nWe were picked up from our hotel 09:15 and dropped off at 16:30. Be warned that this excursion is ran by various other companies who charge on average 3000PHP (£45.64) per person. They promise snacks and photos but for the price it’s not worth it. So far, it’s been the highlight of our trip in Cebu. Most definitely recommend a visit.', 'Mark Thomas', 'This was a fantastic trip! Our group was a family of six with two kids, 11 and 8. Helpful to know this: you will ride from the main road up a paved road on motorcycles or small vehicles to the entrance. After a 5 min overview talk on safety and what to expect, you can either walk 45 min to river side or take a zip line. Wear a bathing suit & and sturdy river shoes or tennis shoes. You will have a guide and he will gladly use you phone/camera (in a waterproof holder) to take photos along the way; the more you stop the longer the typical 3 hour trip will take. Guides provide helmets and sturdy river guide grade life jackets. The limestone rock formations & aquamarine waters are spectacular in a lush, tropical setting. The rocks can be slippery so foot placement is essential. If you are in shape to scramble up, down, under and over rock formations you’ll do OK. My wife & I are 67 & in excellent shape. If you get winded walking just 2 miles this may be a difficult trip. I estimate the river canyon portion of trip to be about 3 miles. Several large pools to jump in/swim across, one has a rope swing. Several of the drops you cannot walk around and must drop into the pools below as instructed. Once you reach the Kawasan Falls section the canyon is developed with pavement & food vendors; it’s no longer the pristine canyon you started in. From this point it was about a 30 min walk on a paved trail back the the outfitters starting point on the main road. Our guides ‘Wolves’ and ‘Barbee’ were excellent! They gave precise instructions, helped us over rocks where needed & were quite good using our phone cameras for regular, panoramic and video shots. Our tour included a meal at the end. We were all sore, tired and smiles at the end of this trip!', 'Roger K', ""Good time!!  It's fun. A bit touristy but it's a good experience.  Add the Whale Shark tourist trap and it makes for a good time."", 'Liau Yuan Wei', 'There are many different tour groups offering canyoneering at Kawasan Falls, for us we booked via the owner of Cuesta Resort (where we were staying). Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn’t. Must do with a local tour guide (Don’t go off on your own) because they really know where’s the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can’t drive in as there’s no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn’t want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn’t take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn’t allow us to jump as the water wasn’t deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks. What the guide wore make the best sense for protection - Swimsuit + Long swimming pants.', 'Christian A', 'It was an amazing experience.

Casa Gorordo Museum,Speciality Museums,"35 Eduardo Aboitiz St, Cebu City 6000 Philippines",548,"['Escapementality', ""A well-preserved house and excellent museum. This place gave us a greater appreciation for and understanding of Cebu's culture and history than any of the other attractions in the area.\n\nThe only reason for taking off half a star (if Trip Advisor would allow such precision!) is due to the lack of subtitles on the audiovisual guide. While it is great that every group of visitors is given a tablet to guide them around the house, due to the outside noise (the house is quite open and you can hear the traffic) it was often difficult for us to hear what was being said. This is especially true given that you have no headphones and must share a device with your group.\n\nAdditionally, when two or more groups were in the same room, it was hard to listen to your own device with the competing noise. For this reason, I'd recommend checking Google Maps for the least busy times (e.g. weekday mornings)  and trying to visit then.\n\nI really hope that museum management will introduce subtitles to their videos so that deaf and hard of hearing visitors can enjoy this content too. While the displays are interesting to see on their own, there is no written signage. I like this approach as it makes the museum feel more like a house and gives you a sense of being transported back in time, however, it does mean that anyone who cannot hear the audio guide misses out on all of the information.\n\nOther than this point, I would highly recommend Casa Gorordo to anyone wanting to better understand Cebu and its past. The staff are extremely helpful and the museum is very well maintained, truly a world-class institution preserving an important part of the Philippines' history and providing an insight into many aspects of life in the past. Good value at 100 per person."", 'Navigator23460576262', 'Thank you so much for your great review.  We really value reviews like this as they inspire us to do more and be better at promoting our loca culture! \n\nWe have noted your suggestion to put subtitles on our AV guide. We will do that.

I’m glad that they were able to preserve such things. I love that they also have a cafe wherein people can chill after touring around the area. I also love that there’s an aircon in the 1st floor since it would be really hot if it didn’t have one. Aside from that, they also provided a brief description in which it won’t consume much of my time reading details since I still have some museums to visit. If you wish to visit here, I would recommend that you visit the place around 4pm or at night. Overall, I would rate Casa Gorordo 10/10.', 'Albert Chan Paran', 'Last week, I received a message from my fellow actress, mommy Doris Banaynal on Messenger that I\'ll be a part of the cast of the upcoming promotional and educational video of Casa Gorordo Museum, which is owned and managed by Ramon Aboitiz Foundation Incorporated (RAFI) under the Culture and Heritage focus area since when it opened to the public in the year 1983. I was thrilled to shoot again after almost a year of community quarantine and this is my first film project in this brand new year 2021. A good start for my year.\n\nWe are asked to dramatize and reenact the traditional ""pamamanhikan""  or ""pamalaye"" in the Philippines during the eighteen-hundreds of the 19th century. This is usually a formal occasion when the man together with his family members formally asks the woman’s hand in marriage in front of her parents, grandparents and the rest of her family.\xa0 Casa Gorordo is the perfect setting of a colonial era house which is known as ""balay na tisa"" (house with tiled roof) during the Spanish occupation in the country located in the historical district of Parian near Colon Street (the oldest street in the Philippines).\n\nWe have to wear the national dress like the traditional Barong (an embroidered long-sleeved formal shirt for men) and \xa0Filipiniana\xa0dress/traje de mestiza (a traditional\xa0dress\xa0for women) to depict the time period in history. \n\nI realized it was my first time to get inside the museum. I\'m not even aware of the history of the house, but because of the guidance of our script writer-researcher, Mr Renren Tabada Alatraca, we learn to appreciate its interesting facts and trivia that open our senses during the entire shoot. It made us understand the background story of the house that we can apply in our performance as actors as we play each character effectively.\n\nThe museum observed the strict health protocols for the staff, the crew and the cast to follow. We\'re told to shoot our scenes by batches. Some actors in the other batch weren\'t with us during the shoot and it was quite a challenge for us to act as if they\'re with us.', 'mama a', ""This one of my favorite place in Cebu that I've visited this yearThe experience on how old days place And it's an historical place"", 'Rojo Tapiador', ""One of the best museum experiences I've had so far.

But going up the 2nd floor, you will get to experience what the early Cebuanos (the rich ones at least) experienced during their time. No Air-conditioning but lots of windows and ways to cool down. I really felt like I was taken back in time every room I enter while playing the appropriate voice and video caption per area of the house.

The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu\'s substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple\'s main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the ""Wishing Well,"" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon\'s Head and Dragon\'s Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple\'s main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the ""Thousand-Hand Guanyin"" and the ""Three Pure Ones.""While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple\'s rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple\'s main altar.In terms of the temple\'s ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple\'s courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks.

Appreciated the shoes as the rocks can be slippery and the ground uneven. This time, there are 8 levels compared to 5 last year. Our guide Andrew is very friendly and helpful. The place itself is still beautiful. But there is less water and some areas are without water. Last year, the water current and the falls were spectacular! Was told there was drought all year?

We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own.

But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.\n\nTo get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.\n\nAt the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.\n\nAt the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.\n\nThe view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.

He trekked with professional mountaineers by then so they themselves gave him tips and tricks to climbing mountains which he was able to use as he became an official guide of the peak. Message me for his contact details if you’re looking for a trustworthy and helping guide. Not only that, we were accompanied by Billy. The cutest and sweetest dog, who the locals say was a tour guide in his past life. He climbed with us all the way up and down the peak, and simply rested while we were busy taking pictures.

But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.To get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.At the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it."", 'Faithalicious_x', ""We arrived for sunset on a cloudy day and even though we couldn't see to far the views of the surrounding mountains and the sunset that we could see was rather nice. The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.The only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is."", 'Anne.Shirako', ""there are 2 ways to get there--hike UP for 3-5 hours through beautiful terrain and mountain farms and villages OR bus to within 1/2 hour of the peak and waltz to the top in flipflops.

During our time, most of the visitors are foreign, you can count with your hands how many are the Filipinos in line. I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn.

It was the first time I was able to go and I appreciate USC very much that they were able to hold such treasures and heritage. As a Filipino youth, I was able to take myself back in the past from the precolonial, indigenous roots to the more contemporary. USC upholds the importance of history and that is shown how the museum is well-curated. I loved the experience as it made me realize the significance of honoring the Filipino roots from the preserved wares for daily living, religious artifacts during the colonial period, to indigenous materials and heritage, revolutionary traditions, and even the fauna of the Philippine wild. It was a very insightful, amusing experience.', 'Shiloah Brook M', ""The museum offered a captivating experience with its extensive collection of interesting artifacts and pieces. Visitors were engaged through interactive activities, such as the paint wall, which added a creative dimension to the visit. Although not as accessible as other museums, likely due to its affiliation with a school, the museum's hidden location added to its charm and exclusivity.
