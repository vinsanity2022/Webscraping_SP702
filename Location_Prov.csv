Kawasan Falls,Tourist site,Waterfalls,"Matutinao, Badian 6031 Philippines","1,936","['Eaten A', 'There was a bit of a walk in along a track, not terribly far but not close either.  You have to pay to park, pay to get in and when you reach the end you arrive at the falls which has a seating and restaurant area which is right next to the pond at the bottom of the falls.  Ruined the illusion of a forest falls a little and we were charged P600 to hire a table to sit at so you either pay or you’re sort of stuffed.  I’d say crowded is not an unfair word to use.  It was nice enough, the falls themselves are nice but not hugely spectacular and you can swim or paddle at least in the pond extending from it.  The bottom of the pond has sharpish volcanic rock so wear some footwear.  I would not go out of my way to go there again unless family had a desire to, a swim in the pool would have been as nice for me as a waterfall directly adjacent a restaurant isn’t quite scenic for me,  I didn’t hate the experience nor did I love it.  Refreshing enough but for me just OK.  You might love it, don’t let my honest review put you off if you are leaning toward going.', 'Malta569', 'We ventured to the beautiful Kawasan falls on a one day excursion. It was truly an amazing experience. We paid 1300PHP (£19.70) per person from a local shop next to the French Cafe in Panagsama Beach. This included pick up from our hotel in Moalboal Centre. The excursion included Canyoneering which was epic and the falls were beautiful! On arrival at the Falls we paid an additional 500PHP (£7..60) per person to do Zip lining). It saved a 45 mins walk through the forest to the actual falls and it was great fun! Lunch was also included and a drink with it. \n\nWe were picked up from our hotel 09:15 and dropped off at 16:30. Be warned that this excursion is ran by various other companies who charge on average 3000PHP (£45.64) per person. They promise snacks and photos but for the price it’s not worth it. So far, it’s been the highlight of our trip in Cebu. Most definitely recommend a visit.', 'Mark Thomas', 'This was a fantastic trip! Our group was a family of six with two kids, 11 and 8. Helpful to know this: you will ride from the main road up a paved road on motorcycles or small vehicles to the entrance. After a 5 min overview talk on safety and what to expect, you can either walk 45 min to river side or take a zip line. Wear a bathing suit & and sturdy river shoes or tennis shoes. You will have a guide and he will gladly use you phone/camera (in a waterproof holder) to take photos along the way; the more you stop the longer the typical 3 hour trip will take. Guides provide helmets and sturdy river guide grade life jackets. The limestone rock formations & aquamarine waters are spectacular in a lush, tropical setting. The rocks can be slippery so foot placement is essential. If you are in shape to scramble up, down, under and over rock formations you’ll do OK. My wife & I are 67 & in excellent shape. If you get winded walking just 2 miles this may be a difficult trip. I estimate the river canyon portion of trip to be about 3 miles. Several large pools to jump in/swim across, one has a rope swing. Several of the drops you cannot walk around and must drop into the pools below as instructed. Once you reach the Kawasan Falls section the canyon is developed with pavement & food vendors; it’s no longer the pristine canyon you started in. From this point it was about a 30 min walk on a paved trail back the the outfitters starting point on the main road. Our guides ‘Wolves’ and ‘Barbee’ were excellent! They gave precise instructions, helped us over rocks where needed & were quite good using our phone cameras for regular, panoramic and video shots. Our tour included a meal at the end. We were all sore, tired and smiles at the end of this trip!', 'Roger K', ""Good time!!  It's fun. A bit touristy but it's a good experience.  Add the Whale Shark tourist trap and it makes for a good time."", 'Liau Yuan Wei', 'There are many different tour groups offering canyoneering at Kawasan Falls, for us we booked via the owner of Cuesta Resort (where we were staying). Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn’t. Must do with a local tour guide (Don’t go off on your own) because they really know where’s the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can’t drive in as there’s no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn’t want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn’t take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn’t allow us to jump as the water wasn’t deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks. What the guide wore make the best sense for protection - Swimsuit + Long swimming pants.', 'Christian A', 'It was an amazing experience. The beauty of the place is overwhelming and the water is so clean and cold. It is one of the best adventure we had.', 'Joyce B', ""The adventure experience I've been trough was amazing cant wait to be there again with my special someone.

And also perfect place for refreshing with the praise Of water as cold', 'Quest53029332308', ""My experience there was amazing. Thank you for your hospitality. The ambiance was good and very relaxing. The staff are approachable . I don't regret that I stayed here. Hopefully I can visit here soon together with my family."", 'Victor jr A', 'The kawasan falls is beautiful place which you can enjoy bounding with friends and family. Aside from its natural beauty kawasan falls has also become famous one of the most popular activities in Cebu.', 'Ljay V', 'Sooo nice here the water is cold. It is nice place. I love nature and I love the falls. I wish I could stay longer.', 'Vanvan20', 'Very nice falls clear water and very nice view you can enjoy the water activities. Highly recommended', 'Adel G', 'Very nice falls clear water and very nice view my husband enjoy the water activities sad to say i didnt know how to swim but as long as my husband is happy ,he want to back here.']"

But at some point before the pandemic the water flow was down to nothing and it was not a great place to visit. \n\nNow however, all that has changed for the better. The water flow is not only great it's exceptional making for a super high, huge and majestic waterfall. It's a little strong to stand directly under the main falls but there are other smaller ones adjacent you can enjoy on your body.  The falls are breathtaking and a true prize in nature. Anyone going to see the whale sharks MUST make a side trip here. \nIn addition to the water falls the area in general is well maintained and they are improving and beautifying the facilities there. You will need to take a motorcycle down to the falls and up from the falls as the roads are steep canyons and they really shouldn't allow cars there to preserve this place a a sanctuary. Although the motorcycle ride was a bit of a thrill ride all by itself it was well organized and inexpensive transportation.  Don't walk it, going down is fine but going up may kill you lol.  \n\nAs a local, I am impressed and excited for the efforts of restoration and organization that it has undergone.

Very impressive size and natural beauty. Not too developed which is good to see.', 'Cedric', 'The waterfall is a short drive from the main road. I recommend taking the motorbike service to visit the waterfall (but be prepared for a short thrill!). The waterfall area is clean, the view is awesome. Worth every shot!', 'FSahertian', 'I saw a lot of beautiful waterfalls, but this was really am amazing waterfall! When we were there the only thing we said was omg what beautiful. It was nice you can also can swim in the very blue lagoon and of course standing under the waterfall... Love it!', 'Liau Yuan Wei', 'After the Oslob Whale Shark Tour, our tour guide Giselle brought us to Tumalog Falls, which is a short drive from there. Note that 4-wheels will have stop at a certain point; then either you walk 3km to the falls, or you pay 150 pesos for motorbike ride to & fro the falls (You pay only when u made the return trip back from the falls). Reason is because the road ahead is too steep for 4-wheels to drive, only the motorbikes there have enough horsepower to carry tourists there. It’s a very beautiful fall and you can take lots of nice pictures with the waterfall! There’s also a small pond with small fishes, then you can dip your feet in for the fishes to bite off your dead skin from your feet! We spent a lot of time there posing for pictures (At least 45mins). Yet again, I think you should go early in morning to beat the crowd, and transport wise it’s best to have a private vehicle bringing you near the falls! We literally wore the swimwear we had from the whale shark tour to the falls, just like the other tourists we saw.', 'Summers On Wheels', 'The falls were actually better than expected. The water was cold but refreshing.Having to use a bike to get up the hill was annoying but it isn’t mandatory or even that expensive considering how steep that hill is.I highly recommend this place for family.Don’t plan on spending more than 1-2 hours here.', 'Trang N', 'This is a beautiful water fall, although it is not that big but I love it.

Must go if in the area!!!"", 'Traveling Ammonite', 'Really fun, scenic waterfalls that you could spend fifteen minutes or an hour in, depending on how you feel.

There is an Entrance Fee of Php 300 per Persons (inclusive of Entrance Fee, Environmental Fees, Guide Fees and Safety Gears (shoes and helmet) and I think it was worth the price.

Osmena Peak,Tourist site,Mountains,"Mantalongon, Dalaguete 6022 Philippines",201,"['R0dent', ""Sadly, on the day I visited, there was light rain and fog which obstructed the view.  But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.\n\nTo get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.\n\nAt the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.\n\nAt the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.\n\nThe view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it."", 'Faithalicious_x', ""We arrived for sunset on a cloudy day and even though we couldn't see to far the views of the surrounding mountains and the sunset that we could see was rather nice. The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.\n\nThe only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is."", 'Taylor S', 'Went here a year but the flashbacks of coming here again is enticing indeed. \nChill ride coming here.

Osmeña Peak is a great beginners level hike. In around 15 minutes you would already have reached the top of the peak. Despite being the highest peak, it’s not that steep at all and is an easy, beautiful hike. The area has been nicknamed ‘Little Baguio’ for its cooler climate and abundant cabbage and lettuce farms. Despite climbing and arriving in gloomy weather, the fog cleared up just minutes before we were about to leave. Exposing the peculiar picturesque landscape of the pointy chocolate hills which we used to our advantage and took thousands of photos immediately. Try and time it so you’re there at sunrise or sunset and avoid wet weather. Kuya Joy, our guide, was such a good sport with taking all our instagrammable pictures and videos. He was like a human drone with all the instructions on how to pose and the video transitions. He also shared to us about how he learned about the peak and being a guide in only 9 years old. He trekked with professional mountaineers by then so they themselves gave him tips and tricks to climbing mountains which he was able to use as he became an official guide of the peak. Message me for his contact details if you’re looking for a trustworthy and helping guide. Not only that, we were accompanied by Billy. The cutest and sweetest dog, who the locals say was a tour guide in his past life. He climbed with us all the way up and down the peak, and simply rested while we were busy taking pictures. We were told that there used to be a group of girls who climbed and put up tents at the peak years ago, but because of the wind and rain their tent broke down, and because they did not have a guide that time, they were worried they wouldn’t be able to go down safely. Luckily, Billy was there. He was right outside their tent. They spoke to him as if he were human and he understood. Billy was able to lead the girls back to safety and that was just one of the many amazing stories about him.As you can see, visiting this place is more than just the beautiful peak itself. It’s the people, the community, the sweat and tears you may break, the reminder of how fragile our lives really are, how big the world is, and the experience.🏷️ ₱50 per person, ₱100 for the required and hired guide. Guides are mandatory.', 'Chi_Tiff', 'I will say this, if you’re going to go to Osmeña Peak, go just before sunset and bring a small picnic or food with you so that you can stay and enjoy the sunset views. It’s a far drive and the way up is quite bumpy. The hike itself it only about 15-20 minutes and the guide I had was lovely!!  I’d definitely visit again, but this time I’d be prepared and make sure it was worth the long drive!!!', 'Athena Gonzales', ""I visited this place during the weekend to unwind. It only took me around 20 minutes to reach the peak, yet the fascinating view, along with the cool mountain breeze, paid off and made the hike way more rewarding than I expected. I had a great time relaxing given that the place wasn't that crowded. Ultimately, the best thing about the place was the locals. The local tour guides were astoundingly kind and hospitable."", 'KhanKluay', 'After almost an hour bike ride from Badian, where we stayed, the bum hurts a bit. After parking the bikes road side, a steepish but not at all strenuous 30 min hike, climbing to the top, the views all over the island are more than rewarding. Many young and even older Filipino folks were climbing and hiking the peak, too, which is THE landmark of southern Cebu Island. It was an amazing experience, which I would do again and again, next time in Cebu. It is also a great activity for those who are based in Moalboal.', 'Taylor S', 'Went here a year but the flashbacks of coming here again is enticing indeed. Chill ride coming here. Relaxing view along the way, too. Short and fun hiking. And the view on the top is simply breathtaking. Best to go there just in time for the Sunrise or Sunset to capture the perfect photos to treasure the experience.', 'Jakub H', 'Way to Osmena for example from Moalboal (about 2 hours with motorbike). The hike is very short. I hiked up by 15 minutes, but i walked quite fast. If there is goof visibility you will have stunning view. If you want to climb it you have to pay fee, but this fee is ridiculous.', 'R0dent', ""Sadly, on the day I visited, there was light rain and fog which obstructed the view.  But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.To get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.At the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it."", 'Faithalicious_x', ""We arrived for sunset on a cloudy day and even though we couldn't see to far the views of the surrounding mountains and the sunset that we could see was rather nice. The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.The only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is."", 'Anne.Shirako', ""there are 2 ways to get there--hike UP for 3-5 hours through beautiful terrain and mountain farms and villages OR bus to within 1/2 hour of the peak and waltz to the top in flipflops. I recommend the hike--it's tough, but you can do it!""]"

I followed Google Maps which directed me down a road off to the left and eventually to a local man who charged 25 pesos. I asked him what the charge is for. He said for the private beach. I told him there are no private beaches in the Philippines (unless it is at a privately owned island). Anyway, I paid the fee which was really for crossing private land. I ended up entering the water before the actual beach.Very nice beach, clean sand and clear water. There was some trash around off the beach. When I left the beach I found a parking area and a public dirt road that led me back to the main road. From the main road there is no sign pointing the way to this beach. Only a big sign with all the rules and regulations to visit the beach. This public road is about 500 metres further on from where Google Maps directs you. Of course the unscrupulous land owner is not honest enough to redirect you to the public road. I stopped two ladies on bicycles and redirected them to the public road. DO NOT follow Google Maps.', 'Mary jean Q', 'This is as the name says, a Paradise Beach. It is the best beach on Bantayan Island; very clean, white powder sand, crystal clear water, great for snorkelling and swimming, also good for cliff jumping when tide is high, very quiet early on mornings for sunrise. It’s only 20 pesos entrance but this pays to keep it clean. It’s a bit hidden away from the busy Santa Fe but that’s why I like it. We also stay at Paradise Beach Guest House which is walking distance to this beach & highly recommend that resort!
