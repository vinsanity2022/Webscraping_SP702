Convenience facilities such as nearby convenience stores are too far away and insufficient.\nThere's a 7-Eleven nearby, but it's too small and there aren't many things, so it's not really worth using.\n2. Check-in takes too long. I don't understand if your staff are doing their job well or if there is something wrong with your hotel system. Even five-star hotels in Manila are much faster than this.\n3. Internet Wi-Fi speed is too slow and cuts off easily.\nThese days, even if you go to a business hotel in Manila, the internet speed is fast. But your hotel has slow wifi and very unstable.\nIt is too inconvenient for journalists like me to write and upload newspaper articles.\n4. There is no Korean food in the hotel breakfast.

Second thing I didn't like is the Elevator, once the elevator door opens and within seconds if you don't enter and when you try to go in then the door closes on you so fast. They need to adjust the timing of their elevator or else it's going to  hurt someone. I almost got hurt by the elevator.

Location was convenient since it’s near to a lot of restaurants and stores. Not sure about the transportation in the area tho cos we opted to rent a car (which I highly suggest you’d do). Everything was perfect except the room service was slow. We were a group of 3 adults and a toddler. We paid for the 3rd adult hence they should be providing for her extra amenities. Everyday we had to call A LOT of times to remind them that they forgot to provide us extra towel, pillow, etc… They even skipped a day since they kept forgetting. You pay P1000 per extra guest by the way. It’s for the extra amenities except - no extra mattress will be provided which we didn’t mind because overall, we had a very comfortable stay. Their breakfast is buffet style which we loved. They had bread, cereals, fresh salad, fried rice and a lot more. The only downside is the egg station. One of us had to line up for the eggs and the queue is too long since there’s only one person doing it and there’s only one frying pan. My mama and i are almost done eating and we were done feeding our baby yet my husband is still lining up for the eggs. XD They’ve been doing this for i don’t know how long and i don’t know if they ever realized this. I hope they invest on a wide griller so the egg man could make enough eggs at a time. OVER ALL?

They offered us a one bedroom apartment and a deluxe room as a replacement (we just chose to stay at the one bedroom apartment) and a complimentary dinner buffet (after a long discussion with them since they initially said that they can\'t do refunds for online payments - they said that they can do a partial refund but I need to call Agoda first so chose the less hassle option which is the dinner buffet)\n\nSo everything seems fine until the following day. After breakfast, I asked the front desk what time we can transfer to the two bedroom apartment bec we have to leave early and will be returning late (they also promised us that they\'ll try to transfer us as early as possible). Was surprised when I was told that our room will be available by noon as it is still being occupied by someone else. So, I tried to clarify things bec it seems like that the ""maintenance"" thing isn\'t true at all - that they just either gave our room to someone else or they overbooked. The guy from the front desk quickly responded that the room undergoing ""maintenance"" will also be available by noon - which is pretty much the same thing right? The room won\'t be available by noon (which is apparently their checkout time).

You have two ATM machines, and a 7/11 beside the entrance; across the street, you can find taxis and habal-habal drivers; the North Bus terminal is just a street away where it has stops to the airport via MyBus, and to Hagnaya port (going to Bantayan islands) via Ceres bus. Lastly, after the North bus terminal is where the SM City Cebu is located. This means you have ACCESS to different restaurants and shops as it is only across the hotel.

The view was also nice because we can see both the port and part of Cebu skyline. Key card is VERY important as you need it to access the elevator and room electricity. Our only con in the room was that the shower area has a poor drainage system.

This place gave us a greater appreciation for and understanding of Cebu's culture and history than any of the other attractions in the area.\n\nThe only reason for taking off half a star (if Trip Advisor would allow such precision!) is due to the lack of subtitles on the audiovisual guide. While it is great that every group of visitors is given a tablet to guide them around the house, due to the outside noise (the house is quite open and you can hear the traffic) it was often difficult for us to hear what was being said. This is especially true given that you have no headphones and must share a device with your group.\n\nAdditionally, when two or more groups were in the same room, it was hard to listen to your own device with the competing noise. For this reason, I'd recommend checking Google Maps for the least busy times (e.g. weekday mornings)  and trying to visit then.\n\nI really hope that museum management will introduce subtitles to their videos so that deaf and hard of hearing visitors can enjoy this content too. While the displays are interesting to see on their own, there is no written signage. I like this approach as it makes the museum feel more like a house and gives you a sense of being transported back in time, however, it does mean that anyone who cannot hear the audio guide misses out on all of the information.\n\nOther than this point, I would highly recommend Casa Gorordo to anyone wanting to better understand Cebu and its past.

Here\'s a detailed review of the temple:The Taoist Temple in Cebu City is a peaceful and contemplative place that offers a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu\'s substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple\'s main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the ""Wishing Well,"" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon\'s Head and Dragon\'s Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple\'s main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the ""Thousand-Hand Guanyin"" and the ""Three Pure Ones.""While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple\'s rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple\'s main altar.In terms of the temple\'s ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple\'s courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks. While this is an optional activity, it is an interesting and unique experience for those interested in the Taoist religion and its practices.Overall, the Taoist Temple is a fascinating and beautiful attraction in Cebu City that offers visitors a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy.

We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own.
