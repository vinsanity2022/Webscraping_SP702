You have to pay to park, pay to get in and when you reach the end you arrive at the falls which has a seating and restaurant area which is right next to the pond at the bottom of the falls.  Ruined the illusion of a forest falls a little and we were charged P600 to hire a table to sit at so you either pay or you‚Äôre sort of stuffed.  I‚Äôd say crowded is not an unfair word to use.  It was nice enough, the falls themselves are nice but not hugely spectacular and you can swim or paddle at least in the pond extending from it.  The bottom of the pond has sharpish volcanic rock so wear some footwear.

It was truly an amazing experience. We paid 1300PHP (¬£19.70) per person from a local shop next to the French Cafe in Panagsama Beach. This included pick up from our hotel in Moalboal Centre. The excursion included Canyoneering which was epic and the falls were beautiful! On arrival at the Falls we paid an additional 500PHP (¬£7..60) per person to do Zip lining). It saved a 45 mins walk through the forest to the actual falls and it was great fun! Lunch was also included and a drink with it. \\n\\nWe were picked up from our hotel 09:15 and dropped off at 16:30. Be warned that this excursion is ran by various other companies who charge on average 3000PHP (¬£45.64) per person. They promise snacks and photos but for the price it‚Äôs not worth it. So far, it‚Äôs been the highlight of our trip in Cebu. Most definitely recommend a visit.', 'Mark Thomas', 'This was a fantastic trip! Our group was a family of six with two kids, 11 and 8. Helpful to know this: you will ride from the main road up a paved road on motorcycles or small vehicles to the entrance. After a 5 min overview talk on safety and what to expect, you can either walk 45 min to river side or take a zip line. Wear a bathing suit & and sturdy river shoes or tennis shoes. You will have a guide and he will gladly use you phone/camera (in a waterproof holder) to take photos along the way; the more you stop the longer the typical 3 hour trip will take. Guides provide helmets and sturdy river guide grade life jackets. The limestone rock formations & aquamarine waters are spectacular in a lush, tropical setting. The rocks can be slippery so foot placement is essential. If you are in shape to scramble up, down, under and over rock formations you‚Äôll do OK. My wife & I are 67 & in excellent shape. If you get winded walking just 2 miles this may be a difficult trip. I estimate the river canyon portion of trip to be about 3 miles. Several large pools to jump in/swim across, one has a rope swing. Several of the drops you cannot walk around and must drop into the pools below as instructed. Once you reach the Kawasan Falls section the canyon is developed with pavement & food vendors; it‚Äôs no longer the pristine canyon you started in. From this point it was about a 30 min walk on a paved trail back the the outfitters starting point on the main road. Our guides ‚ÄòWolves‚Äô and ‚ÄòBarbee‚Äô were excellent! They gave precise instructions, helped us over rocks where needed & were quite good using our phone cameras for regular, panoramic and video shots. Our tour included a meal at the end. We were all sore, tired and smiles at the end of this trip!', 'Roger K', \"Good time!!  It's fun. A bit touristy but it's a good experience.  Add the Whale Shark tourist trap and it makes for a good time.\", 'Liau Yuan Wei', 'There are many different tour groups offering canyoneering at Kawasan Falls, for us we booked via the owner of Cuesta Resort (where we were staying). Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn‚Äôt. Must do with a local tour guide (Don‚Äôt go off on your own) because they really know where‚Äôs the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can‚Äôt drive in as there‚Äôs no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn‚Äôt want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn‚Äôt take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn‚Äôt allow us to jump as the water wasn‚Äôt deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks.

      "[\"Casa Gorordo is a house museum located in the historic Parian district of Cebu, the oldest city in the Philippines. Built in the 1850's, it lived through several important social changes that shaped modern Filipino identity. A tour of the house provides visitors insightful glimpses into the history of Cebu and the rich cultural heritage of Cebuanos. The museum is one of the Philippines' National Historical Landmarks.\", 'Escapementality', \"A well-preserved house and excellent museum. This place gave us a greater appreciation for and understanding of Cebu's culture and history than any of the other attractions in the area.\\n\\nThe only reason for taking off half a star (if Trip Advisor would allow such precision!) is due to the lack of subtitles on the audiovisual guide. While it is great that every group of visitors is given a tablet to guide them around the house, due to the outside noise (the house is quite open and you can hear the traffic) it was often difficult for us to hear what was being said. This is especially true given that you have no headphones and must share a device with your group.\\n\\nAdditionally, when two or more groups were in the same room, it was hard to listen to your own device with the competing noise. For this reason, I'd recommend checking Google Maps for the least busy times (e.g. weekday mornings)  and trying to visit then.\\n\\nI really hope that museum management will introduce subtitles to their videos so that deaf and hard of hearing visitors can enjoy this content too. While the displays are interesting to see on their own, there is no written signage. I like this approach as it makes the museum feel more like a house and gives you a sense of being transported back in time, however, it does mean that anyone who cannot hear the audio guide misses out on all of the information.\\n\\nOther than this point, I would highly recommend Casa Gorordo to anyone wanting to better understand Cebu and its past. The staff are extremely helpful and the museum is very well maintained, truly a world-class institution preserving an important part of the Philippines' history and providing an insight into many aspects of life in the past. Good value at 100 per person.\", 'Navigator23460576262', 'Thank you so much for your great review.

You can either ask the taxi to wait for you or catch one on the way back. There isn‚Äôt a pool of taxis outside waiting for the return journey but don‚Äôt be overcharged by someone saying they will take you for 400 pesos.

It is a beautiful and serene temple that reflects the Taoist philosophy and religion. Here\\'s a detailed review of the temple:The Taoist Temple in Cebu City is a peaceful and contemplative place that offers a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu\\'s substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple\\'s main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the \"Wishing Well,\" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon\\'s Head and Dragon\\'s Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple\\'s main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the \"Thousand-Hand Guanyin\" and the \"Three Pure Ones.\"While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple\\'s rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple\\'s main altar.In terms of the temple\\'s ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple\\'s courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks. While this is an optional activity, it is an interesting and unique experience for those interested in the Taoist religion and its practices.Overall, the Taoist Temple is a fascinating and beautiful attraction in Cebu City that offers visitors a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy.

Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because it does not look very impressive in the photos, but surprisingly I had a very good time! The course was a little bit hard for a weakling like me (I really do not get enough exercise) but not hard enough to make me want to quit halfway. The guides are very friendly and helpful.

We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own.

He was like a human drone with all the instructions on how to pose and the video transitions. He also shared to us about how he learned about the peak and being a guide in only 9 years old. He trekked with professional mountaineers by then so they themselves gave him tips and tricks to climbing mountains which he was able to use as he became an official guide of the peak. Message me for his contact details if you‚Äôre looking for a trustworthy and helping guide. Not only that, we were accompanied by Billy. The cutest and sweetest dog, who the locals say was a tour guide in his past life. He climbed with us all the way up and down the peak, and simply rested while we were busy taking pictures. We were told that there used to be a group of girls who climbed and put up tents at the peak years ago, but because of the wind and rain their tent broke down, and because they did not have a guide that time, they were worried they wouldn‚Äôt be able to go down safely. Luckily, Billy was there. He was right outside their tent. They spoke to him as if he were human and he understood. Billy was able to lead the girls back to safety and that was just one of the many amazing stories about him.As you can see, visiting this place is more than just the beautiful peak itself. It‚Äôs the people, the community, the sweat and tears you may break, the reminder of how fragile our lives really are, how big the world is, and the experience.üè∑Ô∏è ‚Ç±50 per person, ‚Ç±100 for the required and hired guide. Guides are mandatory.', 'Chi_Tiff', 'I will say this, if you‚Äôre going to go to Osme√±a Peak, go just before sunset and bring a small picnic or food with you so that you can stay and enjoy the sunset views. It‚Äôs a far drive and the way up is quite bumpy. The hike itself it only about 15-20 minutes and the guide I had was lovely!!  I‚Äôd definitely visit again, but this time I‚Äôd be prepared and make sure it was worth the long drive!!!', 'Athena Gonzales', \"I visited this place during the weekend to unwind. It only took me around 20 minutes to reach the peak, yet the fascinating view, along with the cool mountain breeze, paid off and made the hike way more rewarding than I expected. I had a great time relaxing given that the place wasn't that crowded. Ultimately, the best thing about the place was the locals. The local tour guides were astoundingly kind and hospitable.\", 'KhanKluay', 'After almost an hour bike ride from Badian, where we stayed, the bum hurts a bit. After parking the bikes road side, a steepish but not at all strenuous 30 min hike, climbing to the top, the views all over the island are more than rewarding. Many young and even older Filipino folks were climbing and hiking the peak, too, which is THE landmark of southern Cebu Island. It was an amazing experience, which I would do again and again, next time in Cebu. It is also a great activity for those who are based in Moalboal.', 'Taylor S', 'Went here a year but the flashbacks of coming here again is enticing indeed. Chill ride coming here. Relaxing view along the way, too. Short and fun hiking. And the view on the top is simply breathtaking. Best to go there just in time for the Sunrise or Sunset to capture the perfect photos to treasure the experience.', 'Jakub H', 'Way to Osmena for example from Moalboal (about 2 hours with motorbike). The hike is very short. I hiked up by 15 minutes, but i walked quite fast. If there is goof visibility you will have stunning view. If you want to climb it you have to pay fee, but this fee is ridiculous.', 'R0dent', \"Sadly, on the day I visited, there was light rain and fog which obstructed the view.  But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.To get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.At the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it.\", 'Faithalicious_x', \"We arrived for sunset on a cloudy day and even though we couldn't see to far the views of the surrounding mountains and the sunset that we could see was rather nice. The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.The only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is.\", 'Anne.Shirako', \"there are 2 ways to get there--hike UP for 3-5 hours through beautiful terrain and mountain farms and villages OR bus to within 1/2 hour of the peak and waltz to the top in flipflops.

There are two huge golden hands, and two small ones. Since the line is quite long for the huge golden hands, I decided to just take a picture with the small ones as we still have another destination that day. I stood in line for almost 20 mins and yet, I'm not even close. Some takes more than 10 minutes in taking pictures. So imagine that? More than 10 minutes per person. During our time, most of the visitors are foreign, you can count with your hands how many are the Filipinos in line. I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn.

       "  'There was a bit of a walk in along a track, not terribly far but not close either.  You have to pay to park, pay to get in and when you reach the end you arrive at the falls which has a seating and restaurant area which is right next to the pond at the bottom of the falls.  Ruined the illusion of a forest falls a little and we were charged P600 to hire a table to sit at so you either pay or you‚Äôre sort of stuffed.  I‚Äôd say crowded is not an unfair word to use.  It was nice enough, the falls themselves are nice but not hugely spectacular and you can swim or paddle at least in the pond extending from it.  The bottom of the pond has sharpish volcanic rock so wear some footwear.  I would not go out of my way to go there again unless family had a desire to, a swim in the pool would have been as nice for me as a waterfall directly adjacent a restaurant isn‚Äôt quite scenic for me,  I didn‚Äôt hate the experience nor did I love it.  Refreshing enough but for me just OK.  You might love it, don‚Äôt let my honest review put you off if you are leaning toward going.',\n",

We paid 1300PHP (¬£19.70) per person from a local shop next to the French Cafe in Panagsama Beach. This included pick up from our hotel in Moalboal Centre. The excursion included Canyoneering which was epic and the falls were beautiful! On arrival at the Falls we paid an additional 500PHP (¬£7..60) per person to do Zip lining). It saved a 45 mins walk through the forest to the actual falls and it was great fun! Lunch was also included and a drink with it. \\n\\nWe were picked up from our hotel 09:15 and dropped off at 16:30. Be warned that this excursion is ran by various other companies who charge on average 3000PHP (¬£45.64) per person. They promise snacks and photos but for the price it‚Äôs not worth it. So far, it‚Äôs been the highlight of our trip in Cebu. Most definitely recommend a visit.',\n",

       "  'This was a fantastic trip! Our group was a family of six with two kids, 11 and 8. Helpful to know this: you will ride from the main road up a paved road on motorcycles or small vehicles to the entrance. After a 5 min overview talk on safety and what to expect, you can either walk 45 min to river side or take a zip line. Wear a bathing suit & and sturdy river shoes or tennis shoes. You will have a guide and he will gladly use you phone/camera (in a waterproof holder) to take photos along the way; the more you stop the longer the typical 3 hour trip will take. Guides provide helmets and sturdy river guide grade life jackets. The limestone rock formations & aquamarine waters are spectacular in a lush, tropical setting. The rocks can be slippery so foot placement is essential. If you are in shape to scramble up, down, under and over rock formations you‚Äôll do OK. My wife & I are 67 & in excellent shape. If you get winded walking just 2 miles this may be a difficult trip. I estimate the river canyon portion of trip to be about 3 miles. Several large pools to jump in/swim across, one has a rope swing. Several of the drops you cannot walk around and must drop into the pools below as instructed. Once you reach the Kawasan Falls section the canyon is developed with pavement & food vendors; it‚Äôs no longer the pristine canyon you started in. From this point it was about a 30 min walk on a paved trail back the the outfitters starting point on the main road. Our guides ‚ÄòWolves‚Äô and ‚ÄòBarbee‚Äô were excellent! They gave precise instructions, helped us over rocks where needed & were quite good using our phone cameras for regular, panoramic and video shots. Our tour included a meal at the end. We were all sore, tired and smiles at the end of this trip!',\n",

       "  'There are many different tour groups offering canyoneering at Kawasan Falls, for us we booked via the owner of Cuesta Resort (where we were staying). Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn‚Äôt. Must do with a local tour guide (Don‚Äôt go off on your own) because they really know where‚Äôs the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can‚Äôt drive in as there‚Äôs no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn‚Äôt want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn‚Äôt take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn‚Äôt allow us to jump as the water wasn‚Äôt deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks. What the guide wore make the best sense for protection - Swimsuit + Long swimming pants.',\n",

Built in the 1850's, it lived through several important social changes that shaped modern Filipino identity. A tour of the house provides visitors insightful glimpses into the history of Cebu and the rich cultural heritage of Cebuanos. The museum is one of the Philippines' National Historical Landmarks.\",\n",

       "  \"A well-preserved house and excellent museum. This place gave us a greater appreciation for and understanding of Cebu's culture and history than any of the other attractions in the area.\\n\\nThe only reason for taking off half a star (if Trip Advisor would allow such precision!) is due to the lack of subtitles on the audiovisual guide. While it is great that every group of visitors is given a tablet to guide them around the house, due to the outside noise (the house is quite open and you can hear the traffic) it was often difficult for us to hear what was being said. This is especially true given that you have no headphones and must share a device with your group.\\n\\nAdditionally, when two or more groups were in the same room, it was hard to listen to your own device with the competing noise. For this reason, I'd recommend checking Google Maps for the least busy times (e.g. weekday mornings)  and trying to visit then.\\n\\nI really hope that museum management will introduce subtitles to their videos so that deaf and hard of hearing visitors can enjoy this content too. While the displays are interesting to see on their own, there is no written signage. I like this approach as it makes the museum feel more like a house and gives you a sense of being transported back in time, however, it does mean that anyone who cannot hear the audio guide misses out on all of the information.\\n\\nOther than this point, I would highly recommend Casa Gorordo to anyone wanting to better understand Cebu and its past. The staff are extremely helpful and the museum is very well maintained, truly a world-class institution preserving an important part of the Philippines' history and providing an insight into many aspects of life in the past. Good value at 100 per person.\",\n",

I was thrilled to shoot again after almost a year of community quarantine and this is my first film project in this brand new year 2021. A good start for my year.\\n\\nWe are asked to dramatize and reenact the traditional \"pamamanhikan\"  or \"pamalaye\" in the Philippines during the eighteen-hundreds of the 19th century. This is usually a formal occasion when the man together with his family members formally asks the woman‚Äôs hand in marriage in front of her parents, grandparents and the rest of her family.\\xa0 Casa Gorordo is the perfect setting of a colonial era house which is known as \"balay na tisa\" (house with tiled roof) during the Spanish occupation in the country located in the historical district of Parian near Colon Street (the oldest street in the Philippines).\\n\\nWe have to wear the national dress like the traditional Barong (an embroidered long-sleeved formal shirt for men) and \\xa0Filipiniana\\xa0dress/traje de mestiza (a traditional\\xa0dress\\xa0for women) to depict the time period in history. \\n\\nI realized it was my first time to get inside the museum. I\\'m not even aware of the history of the house, but because of the guidance of our script writer-researcher, Mr Renren Tabada Alatraca, we learn to appreciate its interesting facts and trivia that open our senses during the entire shoot. It made us understand the background story of the house that we can apply in our performance as actors as we play each character effectively.\\n\\nThe museum observed the strict health protocols for the staff, the crew and the cast to follow. We\\'re told to shoot our scenes by batches. Some actors in the other batch weren\\'t with us during the shoot and it was quite a challenge for us to act as if they\\'re with us.',\n",

But at some point before the pandemic the water flow was down to nothing and it was not a great place to visit. Now however, all that has changed for the better. The water flow is not only great it's exceptional making for a super high, huge and majestic waterfall. It's a little strong to stand directly under the main falls but there are other smaller ones adjacent you can enjoy on your body.  The falls are breathtaking and a true prize in nature. Anyone going to see the whale sharks MUST make a side trip here. In addition to the water falls the area in general is well maintained and they are improving and beautifying the facilities there. You will need to take a motorcycle down to the falls and up from the falls as the roads are steep canyons and they really shouldn't allow cars there to preserve this place a a sanctuary. Although the motorcycle ride was a bit of a thrill ride all by itself it was well organized and inexpensive transportation.  Don't walk it, going down is fine but going up may kill you lol.  As a local, I am impressed and excited for the efforts of restoration and organization that it has undergone. It was much needed to preserve the magnificence of this place.\",\n",

Here\\'s a detailed review of the temple:The Taoist Temple in Cebu City is a peaceful and contemplative place that offers a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu\\'s substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple\\'s main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the \"Wishing Well,\" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon\\'s Head and Dragon\\'s Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple\\'s main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the \"Thousand-Hand Guanyin\" and the \"Three Pure Ones.\"While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple\\'s rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple\\'s main altar.In terms of the temple\\'s ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple\\'s courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks. While this is an optional activity, it is an interesting and unique experience for those interested in the Taoist religion and its practices.Overall, the Taoist Temple is a fascinating and beautiful attraction in Cebu City that offers visitors a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. With its intricate architecture, beautiful landscapes, and serene ambiance, the temple is an ideal destination for those seeking spiritual enlightenment, cultural immersion, and a unique travel experience',\n",

We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own. If you have ample time, it's a decent add-on to Casa Gorordo, since it's so close by. I'd recommend asking if there are guides available.

We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.\\n\\nAt the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.

He was like a human drone with all the instructions on how to pose and the video transitions. He also shared to us about how he learned about the peak and being a guide in only 9 years old. He trekked with professional mountaineers by then so they themselves gave him tips and tricks to climbing mountains which he was able to use as he became an official guide of the peak. Message me for his contact details if you‚Äôre looking for a trustworthy and helping guide. Not only that, we were accompanied by Billy. The cutest and sweetest dog, who the locals say was a tour guide in his past life. He climbed with us all the way up and down the peak, and simply rested while we were busy taking pictures. We were told that there used to be a group of girls who climbed and put up tents at the peak years ago, but because of the wind and rain their tent broke down, and because they did not have a guide that time, they were worried they wouldn‚Äôt be able to go down safely.

Many young and even older Filipino folks were climbing and hiking the peak, too, which is THE landmark of southern Cebu Island. It was an amazing experience, which I would do again and again, next time in Cebu. It is also a great activity for those who are based in Moalboal.',\n",

       "  \"Sadly, on the day I visited, there was light rain and fog which obstructed the view.  But even with obstruction, there is breathtaking mountainous scenery that isn't usual for the Philippines.  The fog made it look like we were hiking up the Himalayas in a scene right out of National Geographic.To get to the trail head from Cebu City, you should take one of many buses from Cebu's South Bus Terminal to Dalaguete.  When alighting after a three hour ride, you can ask a motorcycle driver to take you to the trail head.  We were charged P200 per head for the 30 minute round trip bike ride.At the trail head, you will be solicited to rent a walking stick for P10.  You should definitely take it.  The hike up and down can be slippery and difficult as the trail is unpaved and poorly defined.  You'll be frequently navigating rocks at steep angles.  There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.  Notice the area is sparsely developed which means no medical care if you need it.\",\n",

The hike itself is pretty easy and straightforwards, it takes about 15-20 mins and could be done in flip flops if you really wanted to...we opted for trainers. Entry was 30 pesos, avoid getting a guide - they really aren't necessary at all. We mistakenly thought they were included as part of the ticket only to find at the end of the hike that he was expecting at least 150 pesos.The only drawback to visiting Osmena is how long the journey is from Moalboal. 90 minutes clinging on the back of a motorbike, over bumpy terrain, up and down hills, and around multiple bends was quite a lot to deal with (at least if you haven't been on a motorbike much). So it would be a personal decision as to whether climbing this peak is worth it, given the 3 hour motorbike travel time. In hindsight, I'm not sure that it is.\",\n",

I highly suggest that you make this as your last destination so you can spend all the time here and you won't have to hurry because you still have another place to go but it would be much better if there's someone who facilitates to ensure that a guest won't spend too much time to consider also there are a lot of other guests waiting for their turn.

Now it‚Äôs more than doubled to 120 peso for adults with a concessionary price for others.

       "  'This was a fantastic trip! Our group was a family of six with two kids, 11 and 8. Helpful to know this: you will ride from the main road up a paved road on motorcycles or small vehicles to the entrance. After a 5 min overview talk on safety and what to expect, you can either walk 45 min to river side or take a zip line. Wear a bathing suit & and sturdy river shoes or tennis shoes. You will have a guide and he will gladly use you phone/camera (in a waterproof holder) to take photos along the way; the more you stop the longer the typical 3 hour trip will take. Guides provide helmets and sturdy river guide grade life jackets. The limestone rock formations & aquamarine waters are spectacular in a lush, tropical setting. The rocks can be slippery so foot placement is essential. If you are in shape to scramble up, down, under and over rock formations you‚Äôll do OK. My wife & I are 67 & in excellent shape. If you get winded walking just 2 miles this may be a difficult trip. I estimate the river canyon portion of trip to be about 3 miles. Several large pools to jump in/swim across, one has a rope swing. Several of the drops you cannot walk around and must drop into the pools below as instructed. Once you reach the Kawasan Falls section the canyon is developed with pavement & food vendors; it‚Äôs no longer the pristine canyon you started in. From this point it was about a 30 min walk on a paved trail back the the outfitters starting point on the main road. Our guides ‚ÄòWolves‚Äô and ‚ÄòBarbee‚Äô were excellent! They gave precise instructions, helped us over rocks where needed & were quite good using our phone cameras for regular, panoramic and video shots. Our tour included a meal at the end.

Cost is 1500 pesos + 1000 pesos for Zipline straight to starting point, which we didn‚Äôt. Must do with a local tour guide (Don‚Äôt go off on your own) because they really know where‚Äôs the safe path at through the canyon. We wore the life-vests and helmets provided for by the resort and took a minivan there (Was about 15mins/5km away). We then walked about 20mins in to the starting point (can‚Äôt drive in as there‚Äôs no gravel road, just a small trekking path), where we saw chickens and goats! We didn‚Äôt want to spend so much money on the Zipline so we didn‚Äôt take, although the group ahead of us said it was crazily fun! The canyoneering itself was one of the most exhilarating adventure we had! We trekked through the river, walking on rocks and swimming in the river at certain parts, and we jumped off at 6 different spots during the walk. The jumps ranges from easy 2m jumps to a 15m jump near the end. There was supposedly a 20m jump at the last waterfall but our guide didn‚Äôt allow us to jump as the water wasn‚Äôt deep enough to cushion our fall. We had a hell of time jumping off, especially at the 15m jump as I keep climbing up the cliff to jump 2x! There was also a swing where u pay 10 pesos to swing your body to the river and let go. Our tour guide was also nice to help us take photos with my phone and he knew the best scenic spots to take pictures at! I paid 150 pesos to buy a waterproof pouch at the resort. Overall, I highly recommend this activity, but please be physically okay because there is a lot of walking. My Apple Watch told me we walked for at least 6km. Attire: We wore swimming trunks & wet shoes, which on hindsight was abit crazy because we had microcuts on our bodies & legs while climbing through the rocks.

This place gave us a greater appreciation for and understanding of Cebu's culture and history than any of the other attractions in the area.\\n\\nThe only reason for taking off half a star (if Trip Advisor would allow such precision!) is due to the lack of subtitles on the audiovisual guide. While it is great that every group of visitors is given a tablet to guide them around the house, due to the outside noise (the house is quite open and you can hear the traffic) it was often difficult for us to hear what was being said. This is especially true given that you have no headphones and must share a device with your group.\\n\\nAdditionally, when two or more groups were in the same room, it was hard to listen to your own device with the competing noise. For this reason, I'd recommend checking Google Maps for the least busy times (e.g. weekday mornings)  and trying to visit then.\\n\\nI really hope that museum management will introduce subtitles to their videos so that deaf and hard of hearing visitors can enjoy this content too. While the displays are interesting to see on their own, there is no written signage. I like this approach as it makes the museum feel more like a house and gives you a sense of being transported back in time, however, it does mean that anyone who cannot hear the audio guide misses out on all of the information.\\n\\nOther than this point, I would highly recommend Casa Gorordo to anyone wanting to better understand Cebu and its past. The staff are extremely helpful and the museum is very well maintained, truly a world-class institution preserving an important part of the Philippines' history and providing an insight into many aspects of life in the past. Good value at 100 per person.\",\n",

I was thrilled to shoot again after almost a year of community quarantine and this is my first film project in this brand new year 2021. A good start for my year.\\n\\nWe are asked to dramatize and reenact the traditional \"pamamanhikan\"  or \"pamalaye\" in the Philippines during the eighteen-hundreds of the 19th century. This is usually a formal occasion when the man together with his family members formally asks the woman‚Äôs hand in marriage in front of her parents, grandparents and the rest of her family.\\xa0 Casa Gorordo is the perfect setting of a colonial era house which is known as \"balay na tisa\" (house with tiled roof) during the Spanish occupation in the country located in the historical district of Parian near Colon Street (the oldest street in the Philippines).\\n\\nWe have to wear the national dress like the traditional Barong (an embroidered long-sleeved formal shirt for men) and \\xa0Filipiniana\\xa0dress/traje de mestiza (a traditional\\xa0dress\\xa0for women) to depict the time period in history. \\n\\nI realized it was my first time to get inside the museum. I\\'m not even aware of the history of the house, but because of the guidance of our script writer-researcher, Mr Renren Tabada Alatraca, we learn to appreciate its interesting facts and trivia that open our senses during the entire shoot. It made us understand the background story of the house that we can apply in our performance as actors as we play each character effectively.\\n\\nThe museum observed the strict health protocols for the staff, the crew and the cast to follow. We\\'re told to shoot our scenes by batches. Some actors in the other batch weren\\'t with us during the shoot and it was quite a challenge for us to act as if they\\'re with us.',\n",

The temple was built in 1972 by Cebu\\'s substantial Chinese community, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the city.The temple complex is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision, and it features a beautiful entrance gate that opens up to a flight of stairs leading up to the temple\\'s main courtyard. The stairs are 81 steps long, representing the 81 chapters of the Taoist scriptures.Upon reaching the top, visitors are greeted by a well-maintained and beautifully landscaped courtyard that is filled with symbolic images and sculptures that are significant to the Taoist religion. The temple is ornately decorated with traditional Chinese designs, intricate carvings, and colorful paintings.One of the most significant features of the temple is the \"Wishing Well,\" where visitors can toss two stones into the well while making a wish. If the stones land inside the circle, it is believed that their wishes will come true.Another important attraction is the Dragon\\'s Head and Dragon\\'s Tail, which is said to bring good luck and fortune to visitors who touch them. Visitors must climb the stairs to the temple\\'s main altar to see the beautifully crafted and colorful Taoist deities, such as the \"Thousand-Hand Guanyin\" and the \"Three Pure Ones.\"While the temple is open to the public, it is important to respect the temple\\'s rules and customs. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and they are not allowed to take photos or videos inside the temple\\'s main altar.In terms of the temple\\'s ambiance, the Taoist Temple offers a peaceful and serene atmosphere that is perfect for meditation and reflection. The temple\\'s courtyard is surrounded by lush greenery and offers a panoramic view of the city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.The temple is also known for its fortune-telling activities. Visitors can pay for a consultation with a Taoist monk who can predict their future by interpreting the patterns made by a bundle of 50 sticks. While this is an optional activity, it is an interesting and unique experience for those interested in the Taoist religion and its practices.Overall, the Taoist Temple is a fascinating and beautiful attraction in Cebu City that offers visitors a glimpse into the Taoist religion and philosophy. With its intricate architecture, beautiful landscapes, and serene ambiance, the temple is an ideal destination for those seeking spiritual enlightenment, cultural immersion, and a unique travel experience',\n",

We visited hoping to learn something about the multicultural history of Cebu, but what little we did learn came from looking things up online after the fact.I couldn't help but compare this house to another old house that we visited nearby later in the day, the Casa Gorordo museum. While the Yap San Diego house is much older, Casa Gorordo does a far better job of communicating its history to visitors, with interactive screens, and tablet-based audiovisual tours included in the ticket price.Judging by past reviews, it appears that there used to be costumed tour guides to help people understand the property, but we saw no-one and no mention of any such service. It's incredible to me that both Yap San Diego and Gorordo charge the same 100 peso entry fee when YSD is so much smaller, less preserved, and provides no services to guests, at least when we visited.While I understand that the Yap San Diego house may not have the same funding as Casa Gorordo, surely a photocopied info sheet could be included with the admission. Or at a minimum. signs to help visitors understand the significance of the items in the house. That being said, I question the significance of many of the items. Every room is full of things, many arranged in strange ways (like a ceramic baby Jesus and a stack of abacuses sitting on an old chair). Some seem quite old, others much more modern. And there are no instructions requesting visitors refrain from touching the items or using the furniture. In fact, the majority of visitors appeared to be using the house as a backdrop for selfies, where they could sit in an antique chair by a window, or pretend to have afternoon tea with old dishes. From the people hawking souvenirs outside to the buskers inside. the house has more of a feeling of a tourist trap than a place designed with the history lover or cultural preservation in mind.In short, if you are just looking for a place to take some photos, the Yap San Diego house will probably suit your needs. If you are looking to learn about the history and culture of Cebu, you should either do a lot of research beforehand. or better yet, go to Casa Gorordo instead of you are short on time. It's a real shame, as obviously, the time periods and cultural backgrounds represented by these two houses are quite different, but unless the Yap San Diego Ancestral House takes some steps to educate visitors, I can't really recommend it as a place to learn more about Cebu, at least on its own. If you have ample time, it's a decent add-on to Casa Gorordo, since it's so close by. I'd recommend asking if there are guides available.

There is a high chance of falling without a walking stick if it's foggy or raining.At the trail head, it doesn't look like you can walk all the way to the peak.  But you can with the trail veering left behind some hills all the way up.  You'll just keep going until you reach the top which took us around 30 minutes.  Guides will be available for hire at the trail head for P150 who might be useful when taking photos.The view at sunset might be breathtaking, but the walk down can be treacherous after the sun sets.  In the valleys, it gets really dark really quick.  We had to use the flashlights in our phones.  Had the phones ran out of battery, it'd be near impossible to trek down.
