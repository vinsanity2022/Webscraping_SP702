Food is also on top value', 'We had some small bugs crawling inside our room.', 'Constantine', 'Group', 'The entire staff, particularly Ann and Jerrika, were very attentive, helpful and smart. Good communication skills, they were not too polite or docile. It was the perfect balance of communication and service. The resort is peaceful and gives you lots of freedom. The staff also prepared the room for my birthday and it was wonderful! They all saved our stay in Moalboal and it made a huge difference. Thank you!', 'Andy', 'Couple', 'Very friendly personal, nice place and pool was great, very close location to beach and restaurants, bars', 'Nothing to mention', 'Dianne', 'Couple', 'Clean room.', 'No free breakfast for a slightly pricey hotel.', 'Marina', 'Couple', ""The staff were amazing. I've asked them millions of questions and they're always happy to help and with a smile. They've got tour operator contacts and laundry contacts. \nThe room itself was really spacious and the toilet and bathroom were separate from each other. The plants they've planted around the pool and rooms are so pretty."", 'The bed and pillows could be comfier and bigger. The bed was a bit on the firmer side. Something about the pool made our swim suits go green/weird colour. Location was good and bad. Good cause it was quiet and tucked up on a corner, bad cause you need to walk 6 mins to go to the town centre for food and other things.', 'Karl', 'Group', 'Best out of 3 hotels we had in Moalboal, relaxed atmosphere and lots of greenery. Hope they maintain it well as its pretty new.', 'Staff needs to grown and learn a bit more. Cozy lights (not 4000k) in the room would be nicer.', 'Chris', 'Couple', 'Great location, away from the noise, hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to all the action when required.', 'Synthetic bed sheets and some noise from adjoining rooms. Not world class accommodation, but definitely one of the better ones in Moalboal.', 'Pascal', 'Family with young children', 'Ambience\nSwimming pool\nLocation', 'Cleaning could be better in certain areas. But still would give cleanliness a 9. The resort is really of high standard.', 'Adam', 'Family with young children', 'The hotel is great, decent wifi, size of the rooms is great. The bed ""frame"" is a little weird but it works, the bed is comfortable which goes a long way.\r\nThe pool is awesome, doorbell to order drinks from the bar was a good idea. My daughter loved the pool here as it had a big shallow area to play around in as well as a deeper area for everyone else.', ""The airconditioning needs to be serviced, the staff cleaned it after we mentioned that it wasn't working well. This improved it but I think it needed a bit more of a thorough cleaning."", 'Bree', 'Couple', 'Beautiful stay in Moalboal! Close walk to everythjng near by. Right on the beach (not beach view) and friendly staff. Rooms are cool and spacey. Loved our stay here. The kitchen staff were awsome too with understanding gluten free and made amazing food. Would highly recommend!', 'Aron', 'Couple', 'The staff were so good. They went above and beyond every chance they could. The place was so calm and chilled out, the perfect get away and a as the name says, a secret paradise', 'Nothing', 'Isabella', 'Couple', 'This was a fantastic place to stay. We decided to stay in Moalboal so that we were closer to the attractions (sardine run, turtles, waterfalls etc.) and we are so glad we did! Secret paradise was perfect- the pool was amazing, restaurant was great, the rooms were spacious & all the facilities were kept so clean and beautiful. The reception staff helped us with all our bookings and gave us great recommendations. It was a very short walk (2mins) to the beach, where you could swim with turtles and the sardine run. There are great local restaurants nearby too. We would definitely stay here again!', 'Suzanne', 'Couple', 'Pool was beautiful and large, rooms had a Greek feel to them, very spacious and restaurant had good selection, staff extremely helpful.', 'Shower pressure was very lacking and not hot enough.', 'Cheryl', 'Group', 'Some ants / insects in the room but overall quite happy with the place', 'Suzanne', 'Couple', 'Amazing pool, staff incredibly nice and helpful.

Lovely ambiance - felt very secluded and quiet but so close to everything', 'The smell in the bathroom - think a new exhaust would be warranted']",,
Pescador Island,Tourist site,6032 Moalboal Central Visayas,,,,565,"['joywu1001', ""The guide told us that it was full of beautiful coral and sealife two years ago, but the devastating typhoon killed a lot of it a year ago. Currentlym they're still working to recreate the coral and sealife. During my snorkel, I did see quite a few fish of different colors. I think this place is worth going if you're not a great swimmer, and have worries about the sea current or big waves. The boatmen bring you to a peaceful area where there are no waves, and you can snorkel or dive easily. Snorkeling here boosted my confidence in getting into the waters more."", 'Steve', ""It's an awesome day trip! Take a boat from almost anywhere in Moalboal, sit back, relax and enjoy the 25 to 35 minute ride to Pescador Island. It's just a small little outcrop in the middle of the straight between Cebu and Negros. We don't usually go for the Island itself (there's nothing really on it and it is protected), but it is a favorite spot to hang out, snorkel, dive, and enjoy the beautiful coral reefs surrounding it. I spent my 49th birthday out there. We had three boats full of family and just partied!"", 'Ryan S', 'Had some great diving here despite rough seas. Lots of sea turtles and a very large octopus in a cave. Cathedral chimney that started around 37m deep and rose up was pretty cool. Wish I had more time there.', 'uzmelissa', ""Nice snorkeling spot for corals especially, some people wrote it's not perfect after thypoon may be it's a really better before but at overall it took 1 hour snorkeling around there and we saw lots of corals and fish, it was enough and enjoyable spot for us and our tour brought us to sardines and turtles to Moalboal, we swam 1 hour also there. Tour spots are fare I think, I would recommend ðŸ‘Œ"", 'joywu1001', ""The guide told us that it was full of beautiful coral and sealife two years ago, but the devastating typhoon killed a lot of it a year ago.

And on top of that, 100 per person for environmental tax. We were only 2 persons, so we asked if we can join other groups, they said they don\'t accommodate joiners anymore due to covid. I highly doubt that! I think each boatmen are waiting ""in-line"" for their turn to take tourists and now they want each boatmen to earn each day from the tourists. The more groups of tourists, the more boatmen will be needed! Can u imagine? I think it is unfair! So we didn\'t do the island hopping. Anyway it is only for this island Pescador.And also corals are now dead due to the typhoon but they will not tell you anything, of course! All they want is your money, not your welfare! Take note and Be careful!', 'Frank', ""Avoid going if you're snorkeling. The corals were damaged during a  recent typhoon and there's pretty much nothing left. You are wasting your money if you go. My gf and I were so disappointed. Spend your money on other tours around. Yes, they bring you to Moalboal beach for the sardine and turtles but don't waste your time for Pescador Island."", 'Marc G', ""On the positive side: Nice topography with walls dropping down to -50m, the Skull cave is very interesting.Good place for freediving for advanced divers.On the negative side: every island hoping boat anchors on the shallow plateau, all the hard corals were killed by anchors a long time ago. The site if  over-fished.. It is  be part of the Tanon Strait Marine Park, it has current and it is surrounded by deep water, it should be full of pelagic predators.. But because of constant fishing, it is empty of fish. Divers are lucky if they see a couple of snappers and a skipjack tuna. You ' ll be happy if you like frogfish and nudibranchesLet' s hope that this place will finally get the protection it deserves.."", 'Steve', ""It's an awesome day trip!
