There’s refrigerator, private bathroom, working table, dresser, dry iron, TV, water heater. Relaxing and right for a good sleep. And it is clean too with toiletries provided.\\n\\nFOOD: Puso Restaurant really offers delicious wide variety of food.

Breakfast buffet is a plus because it’s free! Don’t miss their pancake— it’s the best, and of course try their orange marmalade too!😉',\n",

If you're into the night life,majority of the bars and night clubs are nearby just walking distance or you can take a Grabcar or taxi to get there. 2 things I didn't like about Bayfront hotel is the bathroom in the rooms have these Glass door which in my opinion looks unsafe and could potentially fall off and they have these strip on the edge of the glass that sometimes comes off and I had to keep pushing it back again. Second thing I didn't like is the Elevator, once the elevator door opens and within seconds if you don't enter and when you try to go in then the door closes on you so fast. They need to adjust the timing of their elevator or else it's going to  hurt someone. I almost got hurt by the elevator.  Other than that, this place is really amazing, the staff there are truly amazing and they're all willing to assist a guest when needed. The breakfast there is also good.

They had pool towels ready as well. Location was convenient since it’s near to a lot of restaurants and stores. Not sure about the transportation in the area tho cos we opted to rent a car (which I highly suggest you’d do). Everything was perfect except the room service was slow. We were a group of 3 adults and a toddler. We paid for the 3rd adult hence they should be providing for her extra amenities. Everyday we had to call A LOT of times to remind them that they forgot to provide us extra towel, pillow, etc… They even skipped a day since they kept forgetting. You pay P1000 per extra guest by the way. It’s for the extra amenities except - no extra mattress will be provided which we didn’t mind because overall, we had a very comfortable stay. Their breakfast is buffet style which we loved. They had bread, cereals, fresh salad, fried rice and a lot more. The only downside is the egg station. One of us had to line up for the eggs and the queue is too long since there’s only one person doing it and there’s only one frying pan. My mama and i are almost done eating and we were done feeding our baby yet my husband is still lining up for the eggs. XD They’ve been doing this for i don’t know how long and i don’t know if they ever realized this. I hope they invest on a wide griller so the egg man could make enough eggs at a time. OVER ALL? We loved our stay. \\nFor the car rental, contact: 09196088574.',\n",

They offered us a one bedroom apartment and a deluxe room as a replacement (we just chose to stay at the one bedroom apartment) and a complimentary dinner buffet (after a long discussion with them since they initially said that they can\\'t do refunds for online payments - they said that they can do a partial refund but I need to call Agoda first so chose the less hassle option which is the dinner buffet)\\n\\nSo everything seems fine until the following day. After breakfast, I asked the front desk what time we can transfer to the two bedroom apartment bec we have to leave early and will be returning late (they also promised us that they\\'ll try to transfer us as early as possible). Was surprised when I was told that our room will be available by noon as it is still being occupied by someone else. So, I tried to clarify things bec it seems like that the \"maintenance\" thing isn\\'t true at all - that they just either gave our room to someone else or they overbooked. The guy from the front desk quickly responded that the room undergoing \"maintenance\" will also be available by noon - which is pretty much the same thing right? The room won\\'t be available by noon (which is apparently their checkout time). I didn\\'t argue with the guy anymore as I don\\'t want to ruin my day.\\n\\nWhen we came back later that day, our things have already been transferred to the correct room.\\n\\nOverall, our stay was almost perfect other than the \"maintenance\" in our booked room',\n",

When we went to the South Bus terminal at 3 am, they were the ones who called a taxi and even required the taxi driver to put their driver's info in their logbook; an assurance for us to have a safe ride going out.\\n\\nThe breakfast buffet has limited servings but I appreciate that they used a food warmer to ensure that it would still be served hot, unlike other hotels where they serve cold food. We didn't use other amenities besides our room and the luggage counter. Too bad they don't have a pool where we can lounge.\\n\\nThe location is VERY convenient. You have two ATM machines, and a 7/11 beside the entrance; across the street, you can find taxis and habal-habal drivers; the North Bus terminal is just a street away where it has stops to the airport via MyBus, and to Hagnaya port (going to Bantayan islands) via Ceres bus. Lastly, after the North bus terminal is where the SM City Cebu is located. This means you have ACCESS to different restaurants and shops as it is only across the hotel. So it's really beyond 5/5 for the location.\\n\\nAs for the room, we had it on the 12th floor, with two beds. My mom really liked it. It has a television, a refrigerator, and an aircon. The view was also nice because we can see both the port and part of Cebu skyline. Key card is VERY important as you need it to access the elevator and room electricity. Our only con in the room was that the shower area has a poor drainage system. The drainage was far from where the water is pouring so it floods whenever one person finishes their shower.\\n\\nAll in all, it was still a very great place to stay.

No free breakfast, but dining won't be a problem since you'll find an Unlimited Shabu-shabu on the 2nd floor, a confectionary, a Yellow Cab and a Starbucks on the first floor, along with a few food stalls to boot.\",\n",

On top of all of the above they arranged for us a shuttle to the airport in a private and brand new car to the airport at the end of our stay for a very reasonable price, as expected the driver was amazing as well unfortunately I forgot his name.

Internet Wi-Fi speed is too slow and cuts off easily.\\nThese days, even if you go to a business hotel in Manila, the internet speed is fast. But your hotel has slow wifi and very unstable.\\nIt is too inconvenient for journalists like me to write and upload newspaper articles.\\n4. There is no Korean food in the hotel breakfast.

My daughter was picked up in the airport ably assisted by another hotel employee, not just the driver. The room as shown by our daughter had the basics, and so we emailed Ms. Almeda for extras our daughter needed and was sent to her room the following morning. Though there was the construction of another building beside where she was staying, it did not block the nice view of the sea from her room.

Staff were very helpful and courteous. I had a fractured left foot during this visit and thankfully, the staff were quick to help me and make my mobility around thr hotel much easier. With that said, i did have a problem going around as there were no ramps provided for wheelchairs at the entrance/exit at the basement parking area. I had to stand on one foot and wait for the staff to transfer my wheelchair on the elevated entrance then had to hop onto the entrance itself. The hotel still has ongoing infrastructure work so i hope they can provide for this in the soonest possible time.',\n",

If you buy breakfast its P988 or about $20 pp, buy at booking only cost us extra $6 pp. The pool bar and rooftop bar were both well stocked and we took advantage of both.

The reception upon check-in was great his very informative and they pick me to play spin the wheel (won notebook), check out was okay she was struggling coz the queue was long and she was alone.

I think follow up with operation service could’ve done better.

       "  \"I stayed at this place for about a week, loved the environment it's in. Location is amazing, near to everything. If you're into the night life,majority of the bars and night clubs are nearby just walking distance or you can take a Grabcar or taxi to get there. 2 things I didn't like about Bayfront hotel is the bathroom in the rooms have these Glass door which in my opinion looks unsafe and could potentially fall off and they have these strip on the edge of the glass that sometimes comes off and I had to keep pushing it back again. Second thing I didn't like is the Elevator, once the elevator door opens and within seconds if you don't enter and when you try to go in then the door closes on you so fast. They need to adjust the timing of their elevator or else it's going to  hurt someone. I almost got hurt by the elevator.  Other than that, this place is really amazing, the staff there are truly amazing and they're all willing to assist a guest when needed. The breakfast there is also good. Would be much better if all rooms have a food menu. I would definitely be visiting there again\",\n",

       "  'It’s very new and very clean. Our experience was great for its price. The hallways smelled really nice and you won’t worry about security. Pool in the rooftop is nice. They had pool towels ready as well. Location was convenient since it’s near to a lot of restaurants and stores. Not sure about the transportation in the area tho cos we opted to rent a car (which I highly suggest you’d do). Everything was perfect except the room service was slow. We were a group of 3 adults and a toddler. We paid for the 3rd adult hence they should be providing for her extra amenities. Everyday we had to call A LOT of times to remind them that they forgot to provide us extra towel, pillow, etc… They even skipped a day since they kept forgetting. You pay P1000 per extra guest by the way. It’s for the extra amenities except - no extra mattress will be provided which we didn’t mind because overall, we had a very comfortable stay. Their breakfast is buffet style which we loved. They had bread, cereals, fresh salad, fried rice and a lot more. The only downside is the egg station. One of us had to line up for the eggs and the queue is too long since there’s only one person doing it and there’s only one frying pan. My mama and i are almost done eating and we were done feeding our baby yet my husband is still lining up for the eggs. XD They’ve been doing this for i don’t know how long and i don’t know if they ever realized this. I hope they invest on a wide griller so the egg man could make enough eggs at a time. OVER ALL? We loved our stay. \\nFor the car rental, contact: 09196088574.',\n",

I stayed 3 nights but only had one time when the room was attended. Rhe second time, it was too late and I didn’t want to go out of the room andI told them, it’s all good though they asked if I want anything lime water. Second is the hassle of checking in.

They offered us a one bedroom apartment and a deluxe room as a replacement (we just chose to stay at the one bedroom apartment) and a complimentary dinner buffet (after a long discussion with them since they initially said that they can\\'t do refunds for online payments - they said that they can do a partial refund but I need to call Agoda first so chose the less hassle option which is the dinner buffet)\\n\\nSo everything seems fine until the following day. After breakfast, I asked the front desk what time we can transfer to the two bedroom apartment bec we have to leave early and will be returning late (they also promised us that they\\'ll try to transfer us as early as possible). Was surprised when I was told that our room will be available by noon as it is still being occupied by someone else. So, I tried to clarify things bec it seems like that the \"maintenance\" thing isn\\'t true at all - that they just either gave our room to someone else or they overbooked. The guy from the front desk quickly responded that the room undergoing \"maintenance\" will also be available by noon - which is pretty much the same thing right? The room won\\'t be available by noon (which is apparently their checkout time). I didn\\'t argue with the guy anymore as I don\\'t want to ruin my day.\\n\\nWhen we came back later that day, our things have already been transferred to the correct room.\\n\\nOverall, our stay was almost perfect other than the \"maintenance\" in our booked room',\n",

We were on the ground floor waiting for the elevator to come down but when it reached the 5th floor from the upper floors, we were expecting that it will move down but instead it moved up and it was like that many times. We asked the staff if it is okay to use the stairs because we got tired of waiting, but we were not allowed to. We waited for almost 20min until it reached the ground floor.  The reason why it was like that was because there were 2 events that night as per the staff.\\nOn a positive note, the location is very accessible and convenient. The price was very worth it considering that it includes breakfast buffet for 2 and the foods were delicious.',\n",

When we went to the South Bus terminal at 3 am, they were the ones who called a taxi and even required the taxi driver to put their driver's info in their logbook; an assurance for us to have a safe ride going out.\\n\\nThe breakfast buffet has limited servings but I appreciate that they used a food warmer to ensure that it would still be served hot, unlike other hotels where they serve cold food. We didn't use other amenities besides our room and the luggage counter. Too bad they don't have a pool where we can lounge.\\n\\nThe location is VERY convenient. You have two ATM machines, and a 7/11 beside the entrance; across the street, you can find taxis and habal-habal drivers; the North Bus terminal is just a street away where it has stops to the airport via MyBus, and to Hagnaya port (going to Bantayan islands) via Ceres bus. Lastly, after the North bus terminal is where the SM City Cebu is located. This means you have ACCESS to different restaurants and shops as it is only across the hotel. So it's really beyond 5/5 for the location.\\n\\nAs for the room, we had it on the 12th floor, with two beds. My mom really liked it. It has a television, a refrigerator, and an aircon. The view was also nice because we can see both the port and part of Cebu skyline. Key card is VERY important as you need it to access the elevator and room electricity. Our only con in the room was that the shower area has a poor drainage system. The drainage was far from where the water is pouring so it floods whenever one person finishes their shower.\\n\\nAll in all, it was still a very great place to stay. Highly recommended for its location and convenience!\",\n",
